# Name Popularity Visualizer

This program takes a name and a gender as user input and displays the popularity and meaning of that name in the console.

The name popularity information is based on data from the Social Security Information (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/).

The specifications for this project was provided on the UW Seattle CSE 142 summer 2017 website (https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/17su/homework.shtml).
