# Name Popularity Visualizer

This program takes a name and a gender as user input and displays the popularity and meaning of that name in the console.

Each number represents how popular a given name was for each decade, depending on a certain starting year. For example, a popularity of 1 (highest) would mean that that name was the 1st most popular name for that decade. A popularity of 1000 (lowest) would mean that that name was the 1000th most popular name for that decade.

Then, the program plots the popularity of the name as a bar chart, with the height of each bar representing how popular the name was for a particular decade.

I should note that the default name popularity file is names.txt with a start year of 1890. If names2.txt, then the start year should be 1863.

The name popularity information is based on [data from the Social Security Information](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/).

The specifications for this project was provided on the [UW Seattle CSE 142 summer 2017 website](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/17su/homework.shtml).
